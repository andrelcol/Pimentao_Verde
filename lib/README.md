librcsc is a basic library to develop a simulated soccer team and related tools for the RoboCup Soccer Simulation.
All programs can work with rcssserver-18.

- The RoboCup Soccer Simulator: https://rcsoccersim.github.io/
- RoboCup Official Homepage: https://www.robocup.org/

## Quick Start

The latest librcsc depends on the following libraries:
 - C++17
 - Boost 1.41 or later https://www.boost.org/

In the case of Ubuntu 20.04 or later, execute the following commands for installing a basic development environment:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libboost-all-dev autoconf automake libtool cmake
```

To build the library, execute commands from the root of source directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

Once successfully built, you can install the library file and header files to the default installation directory (``/usr/local/cyruslib``):
```
make install
```
## Uninstall

librcsc can also be easily removed by entering the distribution directory and running:
```
make uninstall
```
This will remove all the files that where installed, but not any directories that were created during the installation process.
